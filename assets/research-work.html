        <h3>A Convolutional Neural Network Based Device-Free Indoor Localization Using CSI DATA</h3>
        <p>
            Paper submitted at IEEE R10 HTC 2023. <br>
            This paper is based on modern day localication as we have large infrastructures where GPS can't give an accurate reading on 
            someone's location. Using our CSI based wifi signal we were able to localize people with a distance error of less than 1 meter. <br>
